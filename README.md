# Real-time Object Detection Android App (Kotlin & XML)

## Overview
This Android app enables real-time object detection using the Camera2 API and TensorFlow Lite. It processes live frames at 30 FPS, detects objects across 16 classes with 90% accuracy, and renders smooth overlays at 60 FPS using Canvas.

## Features
- **Real-time Processing:** Captures frames at 30 FPS, ensuring smooth and responsive detection.
- **TensorFlow Lite Integration:** On-device object detection with optimized deep learning models.
- **Efficient Rendering:** Canvas-based overlays for highlighting detected objects at 60 FPS.
- **Optimized Performance:** Low-latency processing with reduced app size (<50 MB) for better usability.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Kotlin
- **UI Design:** XML
- **Camera API:** Camera2 API
- **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow Lite
- **Graphics Rendering:** Canvas API

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/realtime-object-detection.git
   cd realtime-object-detection
   ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Sync Gradle and build the project.
4. Install and run the app on an Android device with Camera2 API support.

## Usage
- Launch the app and grant necessary camera permissions.
- The camera will start detecting objects in real time.
- Detected objects will be highlighted with bounding boxes and labels.
